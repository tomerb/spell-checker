Spell-Checker by Tomer Barletz.

Build instructions
------------------
* Type 'make' to create a shared library that can be linked with an app.
* Type 'make test' to build and link a test app with the library. Run this test
  app by exporting the library path to the current directory (export
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.), and running the executable test_spellcheck.

TODO
----
* See TODO comments in the code.
* Need more testing. Much more testing. Right now there is a simple app that
  is utilizing the basic funcionality.
